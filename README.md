### Links

- Live Site URL: [Social Proof Section](https://arey-dev.github.io/social-proof-section-page/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how complicated responsiveness can be. I had troubles with my layout, especially when setting heights. I wasn't not sure at all if it's okay to set heights in the first place.

I understand when and when not to use CSS Grid much better now.

### Continued development

I want to practice CSS Grid model more and get used to it. I also want to deepen my understanding of accesibility, I think it will be a great practice to consider screen reader features.
